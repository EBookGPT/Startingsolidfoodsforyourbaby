Egg whites can cause an allergic reaction in some babies. Wait until your baby is closer to one year old before introducing them to eggs.

Peanuts are a common allergen and should not be introduced to babies until they are at least 12 months old. Avoid giving your baby peanut butter, peanut oil, or any food that contains peanuts.
