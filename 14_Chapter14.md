To provide valuable insight, we are honored to have special guest Gill Rapley, a renowned public health nurse and the pioneer of baby-led weaning, to guide us through this exciting journey.

Baby-led weaning involves allowing your baby to feed themselves, using solid pieces of food instead of purees. This method aims to promote healthy eating habits, improve oral motor skills, and encourage self-regulation of food consumption. 

We will discuss the benefits and risks associated with baby-led weaning, as well as how to get started and what foods to offer. Gill Rapley will share her expertise and answer frequently asked questions about this feeding method.

We hope this chapter will provide you with valuable information on baby-led weaning and help you make the right decision for you and your baby. Let's get started!
# Chapter 14: Baby-Led Weaning

Welcome to the fourteenth chapter of our book on Starting solidfoods for your baby. 

## 14.1 What is Baby-Led Weaning?

Baby-led weaning (BLW) is a feeding method that involves skipping spoon-feeding and allowing baby to control what and how much they eat. Instead of purees, infants are offered solid pieces of food that they can pick up and self-feed. This method aims to promote healthy eating habits, improve oral motor skills, and encourage self-regulation of food consumption.

## 14.2 Benefits of Baby-Led Weaning

- Promotes the development of fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination as baby self-feeds
- Encourages healthy eating habits as baby learns to eat a variety of foods at their own pace
- Allows for self-regulation of food intake to prevent overeating and obesity in later life
- Helps to introduce a wide variety of tastes and textures to baby
- Strengthens the bond between parent and baby as they explore food together

## 14.3 Risks and Precautions of Baby-Led Weaning

- Risk of choking if baby is not developmentally ready for solid pieces or if given food that is a choking hazard
- Risk of malnutrition if baby is not offered a variety of nutrient-dense foods
- Potential for messy mealtimes

To minimize the risks of choking, it is important to ensure that baby is developmentally ready for solid pieces and to offer safe, age-appropriate foods. We will discuss this in more detail with Gill Rapley below.

## 14.4 How to Get Started with Baby-Led Weaning

Before starting baby-led weaning, it is recommended to consult with your pediatrician and to ensure that your baby is developmentally ready. Some signs of readiness include being able to sit up unassisted, showing interest in food, and having good hand-eye coordination.

When beginning BLW, offer baby soft, easily-digestible foods that are cut into safe, manageable pieces. Encourage exploration and self-feeding by allowing your baby to touch and taste the food at their own pace.

## 14.5 Recommended Foods for Baby-Led Weaning

Baby-led weaning encourages the introduction of a variety of tastes and textures to infants. Some safe and nutritious options to offer include:

- Soft-cooked vegetables, such as sweet potato, broccoli, and carrots
- Ripe fruits, such as avocado and banana
- Cooked meat and poultry, cut into small pieces
- Cooked fish or tofu, cut into small pieces
- Soft-cooked grains, such as oatmeal

When done correctly, BLW can promote healthy eating habits, improve motor skills, and encourage self-regulation of food intake. As with any feeding method, it is important to consult with your pediatrician and ensure that your baby is developmentally ready before starting.
